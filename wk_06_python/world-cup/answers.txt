Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Traditional favorites were not part of the simulation results starting with N=100

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
Based on the results observed, and the stability in results, "good enough" starts with N=1000
